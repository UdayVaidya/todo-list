ðŸš€ Exciting Milestone: My First JavaScript Project! ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed my very first project using JavaScript! This experience has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding, and Iâ€™m eager to continue building on this foundation.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview:
For this initial project, I created a simple yet functional to-do list application. The main features include:

Adding tasks with a single click.
Marking tasks as complete.
Removing tasks when they are done.
ðŸ”§ Key Learnings:

DOM Manipulation: I learned how to dynamically update the content and structure of the webpage.
Event Handling: Implementing click events to make the application interactive.
Basic Debugging: Debugging code and resolving issues taught me problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
Code Organization: Structuring code efficiently for readability and maintenance.
